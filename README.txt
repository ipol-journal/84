# OVERVIEW

Given an image f, the algorithm computes a new image $u$ with the same gradient and with minimum variance. The solution is obtained by solving a Screened Poisson Equation using the Fast Fourier Transform as described in IPOL
     http://www.ipol.im/pub/algo/mps_screened_poisson_equation/

This program reads a PNG image, given L the tradeoff parameter between the two terms of the functional, and  s the percentage of saturation of the simplest color balance the program computes a new PNG image as the solution of the screened Poisson equation.
The program works on each color channel independently.

# REQUIREMENTS

The code is written in ANSI C, and should compile on any system with
an ANSI C compiler.

The io_png library is required for read and write a png image.

The libpng header and libraries are required on the system for
compilation and execution. See http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

The fftw3 header and libraries are required on the system for
compilation and execution. See http://www.fftw.org/

# COMPILATION

Simply use the provided makefile, with the command `make`.

# USAGE

screened_poisson L  input   sim_input  output [s]
	L 		the tradeoff parameter of the functional in (0, 2]
	input	 	input file
	sim_input	simplest color balance of the input
	output  	the solution after a simplest color balance with s% 			of saturation
        [s]		optional parameter, the percentage of saturation of 			the simplest color balance, by default 0.1.
